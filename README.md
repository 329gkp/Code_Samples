The analysis and software development work I performed during my PhD is kept in the
private repositories of my collaborations.  In this repository, you can find shortened,
limited samples of my own authored contributions to get an idea of how my 
analyses were conducted.   Reach me at grant.parker@mavs.uta.edu for any questions.
